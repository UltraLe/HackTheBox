# Hack The Box Stuff

This repository holds the writeups (.md files and executable of script used) that I made for some HTB machines. I am sorry to say that some writeups are written in italian. All the archive are protected with a random (and different) password. 

PM me via HTB if you want to check on some of them.

Theese writeups are not intended to be used to spoiler the procedure used to get the machines, but it is a way to hold all my work on htb.
